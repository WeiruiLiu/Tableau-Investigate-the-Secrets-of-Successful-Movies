# Investigate the Secrets of Successful Movies - Tableau Desktop and Tableau Pre Builder
Individual Project: Rayna Liu

## Background and Introduction
As a James Bond fan, I went to the cinema two weeks ago to see the film No Time to Die， which was brilliant and sold well, and it also had a 7.5/10 rating on IMDB. Looking at the success of the 007 series, I want to know what kind of movies are more successful. In other words, what kind of movie gets a higher IMDB score. So, for my project, I selected IMDB movies dataset.

## Dataset
**movies.csv**

This dataset contains important statistics from movies, with 3,177 observations and 16 variables: Worldwide Gross, Production Budget, Major Genre, Creative Type, Director, IMDB Rating, etc. Most columns contain “null”, and if I eliminated all null-containing rows, there wouldn’t be many movies left to analyze. So, I decided to keep “null” but exclude them from the visualization.

## Visualization in Tableau Public
